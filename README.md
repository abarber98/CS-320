How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Writing extensive tests, frequent testing, and understanding requirements

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Ask a lot of questions and make sure you are on the same page as the client. Stick to the requirements and model your tests around them

How do I approach designing software?

I always read through the requirements and make sure I fully understand them. Then I break the program down into smaller digestable pieces and make a plan of how I will execute them. Then I implement tests and ensure the results are in line with the requirements.
